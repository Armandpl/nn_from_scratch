# Neural Net from scratch

This is my first atempt at implementing a neural net from scratch, without looking at any code.

## Usefull ressources:
(http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html)

## Todo
* finish implementing multiple activation functions
* implement one cycle policy
* implement multiples loss functions
* implement multiple layer types
* implement multiple metrics
* numpy exp overflow ?
